# AirBnB Clone - The Console
This is a project for building an AirBnB clone command-line interface (CLI) implemented in Python. The CLI serves as the first step towards developing a comprehensive web application similar to AirBnB. The CLI allows users to manage AirBnB objects, perform various operations on them, and interact with the application.

## Background Context
Before diving into the project, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the AirBnB concept. Please refer to the AirBnB Concept Page to familiarize yourself with the underlying concepts.

## About the Project
The primary goal of this project is to create a command interpreter in Python that facilitates the management of AirBnB objects. This initial step is crucial as it forms the foundation for subsequent phases, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

## Learning Objectives

Creating a Python package.
Developing a command interpreter using the cmd module.
Implementing unit testing for a sizable project using the unittest module.
Serializing and deserializing classes.
Reading and writing JSON files.
Managing datetime objects.
Utilizing UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).
Handling *args and **kwargs in Python functions.
Managing named arguments in functions.

## Features
The CLI provides the following functionalities:

Creation of new objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place).
Retrieval of objects from files or databases.
Operations on objects (counting, computing statistics, etc.).
Updating attributes of objects.
Deletion of objects.

## Getting Started
To begin working with the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run ./console.py to start the interactive mode of the command interpreter.
